Routes:
The application routes are grouped by GET and POST methods.

The GET method routes are in the get.js file.
The POST method routes are in the post.js file.

The routes are ordered in alphabetical order, where the following rules apply:
1. Order first by domain (e.g. 'group' before 'user')
2. Order then by path (which should match the route function)
